# More Ruby on Rails Fun!

Ruby version:	2.0.0 (x86_64-darwin12.4.1)

This is the second repository created while I learn Ruby on Rails via the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). It will follow Chapter 3, which focuses on testing and creating static pages.
